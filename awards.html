                            In primary 3-6, I was a scout leader for my CCA. <br>
                            I carried out simple tasks such as being involved with organizing and planning out our activities<br>
                            for our CCA sessions. To be completely honest, most of the time was just helping the teachers
                            with mundane tasks and I really didn't do that much work since in Primary School, teachers do plan and
                            carry out the main activities. Being a scout leader was a fun position for me and I would honestly like to be one again hehe.

                            Secondary 1 was the year where I actually decided to set my life straight. 
                            Before secondary school, I was an extremely playful kid. I didn;t like studying and always goofed around.
                            However after being posted into Normal Academic (Laterally Promoted to exp in 2019) I decided to be responsible
                            and began to study seriously. I would spend my days after school studying instead of playing video games as I 
                            wanted to improve my academics. <br><br>
                            Through hardwork and dedication towards studying, I've managed to achieve this wonderful achievement and is one that I
                            treasure dearly. (Never in a thousand years would I have expected to get a scholarship award.)

                            In order to be laterally promoted into the Express stream from Normal Academics, I needed an average grade score of 70%.
                            However, in secondary 1, I was 0.5% away from achieving my goal. I was really disappointed with myself and decided to push myself even further.
                            The urge of wanting to be promoted into express made me realize how important education really is. <br><br>

                            I'm honestly quite proud of myself receiving a Scholarship award back to back and it's become a strange addiction for me to try to achieve as much as I could
                            for not only in secondary school but outside of education in general, to do everything to the best of my abilities.

                            Woohoo! <br> After all the hard sweat and tears I've put into my studies and revision, I've finally achieved one of my goals of
                            being promoted to express with an average grade of 76% across all my subjects!

                            Design and Technology (DNT) was the best out of the other 2 subjects listed in the certificate.
                            I was really really close to beating my other friend who promoted to Express as well in SBB/Express Math.
                            If I recall correctly I was just 5 marks away :*( 
                            <br><br> 
                            I found history and science really interesting and was fascinated by singapore's history of WW2 as well as basic physics and chemistry for science.
                            Though my english isn't really my strong point (still decent), I was shocked that I was top in my cohort for that as well!

                            I'm not entirely sure to why I received this award even though my grades were mediocre <br>[High B - Mid A (EXCEPT FOR HUMANITIES 💀)].<br><br>
                            One possible reason could be because I was the only one in my class that passed humanities in secondary 3 and maybe other classes were also struggling?<br>
                            But thats the only reason I could think of that has made be achieve this achievement lol.
