                    <p>
                        Hey there!
                        <br><br>
                        My name is Addison, I am a year 1 student who is currently studying in Ngee Ann Poly
                        and persuing a degree in Information Technology (IT). <br>
                        I am a normal human being who does human stuff like hanging out with my friends and putting in effor for my studies.
                        <br><br>
                        I have a burning passion and interest for anything related to technology or programming.
                        Though my parents are not as tech savy as teenagers these days, I taught myself about the current trends of technology
                        as as thinkering with arduino through the power of the internet and reddit forums. 
                        <br><br>
                        I am a self-motivated and driven person and I don't mind learning new things as long as I have an interest in the subject.
                        I work well with other people and always have an open ear to listen to their opinions and suggestions before giving my opinions or suggestions and acting on it.
                        Though I may be a shy and quiet individual who might be socially awkward at times, I love talking to new people and making new friends :)
                        <br><br>
                        During my free time, I like to mix and produce electronic music (hybrid trap & (kawaii) future bass), play video games with my friends, watch anime and do some programming for my own personal projects.
