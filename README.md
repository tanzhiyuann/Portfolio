README.md IS STILL NOT COMPLETE, will continue to document as I progress!

## Purpose Of Application
<b>Intended user audience :</b> Adults looking for potential employees<br />
<b>Intent & Purpose :</b> For them to consider me a good candidate and potentially hire me <br />
<b>Intended user audience :</b> Working Adults 
<b>Intended user audience :</b> Working Adults 

> A functional website to display my skills, talents and inform the user more about me. The website should be responsive and interactive to impress the audience/user with my current programming knowledge and potentially hire me.
<br />


## Reasons for Designs
> A clean, simple and easy website to navigate website. <br />
I went with a primarily <b>dark theme</b> as if the audience is viewing in a dark environment, it would be less painful on their eyes then being "flash banged" by a bright white theme.

>However, for my achievement page, I went with a white Design as I wanted the user to be "awake" when viewing my achievements and breakout from the mundane and repetitive dark theme. <br />
<b>(switch up in theme = more exciting imo)</b>
