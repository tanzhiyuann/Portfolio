## Reasons for Designs
> A clean, simple and easy website to navigate website. <br />
I went with a primarily <b>dark theme</b> as if the audience is viewing in a dark environment, it would be less painful on their eyes then being "flash banged" by a bright white theme.

>However, for my achievement page, I went with a white Design as I wanted the user to be "awake" when viewing my achievements and breakout from the mundane and repetitive dark theme. <br />
<b>(switch up in theme = more exciting imo)</b>
